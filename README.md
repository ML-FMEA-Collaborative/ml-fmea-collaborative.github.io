# ML FMEA Collaborative

A collaborative initiative to apply and enhance the ML FMEA (Machine Learning Failure Mode and Effects Analysis) technique across industries for safer AI systems.

## About

The ML FMEA Collaborative brings together stakeholders from automotive, healthcare, aerospace, defense, manufacturing, and other industries to advance the ML FMEA methodology. This technique combines established ML development practices with the Process Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (PFMEA) framework to systematically identify and mitigate risks throughout the ML pipeline.

## Website

This repository hosts the static website for the ML FMEA Collaborative, built for GitHub Pages hosting.

### Local Development

To run the website locally:

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser, or
3. Use a local server (e.g., `python -m http.server 8000`)

### Deployment

The website is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the main branch.

## Key Features

- **Cross-Industry Application**: Applicable across automotive, healthcare, aerospace, defense, and other safety-critical industries
- **Systematic Risk Identification**: Identifies potential failure modes throughout the entire ML pipeline
- **Stakeholder Collaboration**: Brings together ML engineers, safety professionals, and domain experts
- **Standards Compliance**: Aligns with ISO 21448, UL 4600, ISO PAS 8800, and other safety standards
